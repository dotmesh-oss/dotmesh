		Here, we need to check for the basic availability of things we require from the platform, such as etcd and zfs.

		This is run as a dedicated service on its own port, because the
		main listener is only started once we've caught up with the latest
		in etcd, and that can take a while. For Kubernetes liveness checks,
		we need a separate listener that's started before anything
		non-constant-time happens, or the daemon gets killed as it's trying
		to start up with lots of dots/commits to process :'-(
